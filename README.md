Simon Game using JavaScript.

## How to play: 
* Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence (ex. blue). Then you have to click on the blue button.
* Next, the game shows the next colour (ex. red), then you have to remember the sequence is blue, red and click the buttons in the same sequence and so on and so forth.
* If you mess up the sequence, then the game ends.

## Things that I learned
1. Working of event listener in javascript
2. Arrays
3. if-else statement
